# hello-world
First ever Github project to learn the ropes of Github.

Hi, I'm Jonathon. I live in Salt Lake City. I have a beautiful wife and 3 kiddos. This is my first adventure with Github. I have been learning to code on my own which has been a lot of fun but I'm super stoked to get to school in a couple weeks and really dig in. I'll be attending a coding bootcamp through the University of Utah. Can't wait to commit some real code to Github as soon as possible.
