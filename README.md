This was my first ever GitHub anything. Now its my playground. This is where I practice and experiment with pieces of code so I can learn how to be a better coder. This code will always change and always do something different. Code will be created and discarded regularly.

I'm Jonathon. I live in Salt Lake City I'm planning to mive to Oregon. I have a beautiful smarter than me wife and 3 cooler/cuter than me kiddos. I've been a graphic designer and illustrator for the last 20 years and now I'm learning code so I get myself into web design. I'm attending the UofU coding bootcamp and doing my best to learn JavaScript. I'll be working on this page a lot.
